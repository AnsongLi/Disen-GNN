# Disen-GNN
## Paper and code
This is the code for the Paper: [Disentangled Graph Neural Networks for Session-based Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03482). We have implemented our methods in **Pytorch**.
## Usage
The code contains the datasets that has been processed, i.e., diginetica,Nowplaying,Yoo etc.
Then you can run the file ````code\main.py```` to train the model.  
For example:
```` python main.py --dataset diginetica````
## Requirements
Python 3 ï¼›PyTorch 1.9.1
